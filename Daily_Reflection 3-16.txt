Reflection 3-16-16-1

I found out that I aced my exam which I am very proud of!
I am now in the more advanced group and all signs point to us starting to move at a good clip.
I am ready to be pushed to learn more than what is achievable and then hopefully achieve those goals before I break mentally.
Our first assignment seemed relatively simple to begin with but after diving in it is very tough.
I have a great start however and I think I should be able to knock it out with about another hour or twos work.

Here is to another crazy day, can't wait for what tomorrow brings.
