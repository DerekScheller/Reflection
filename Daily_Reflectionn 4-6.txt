Reflection 4-6

Today we spent most of the day working on the custom string manipulation project. 
It seems that Adam and I are the only two who have completed all of the project as assigned.
I am happy with the how it turned out and ready to move on to the next dictionary assignment. 
I think that it looks quite simple but we also recieved a calculator assignment that seems extremely tough.
For that reason I am going to try to finish the dictionary tonight after class so that I can spend tomorrow working on the calculator.
I plan to skip the challenge portion of the dictionary assigment so that I can attempt to use dependency injection on my calculator.
