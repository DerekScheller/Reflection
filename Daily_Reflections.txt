Tracking my days at DevCodeCamp:

Today we learned a couple of basic computer science concepts.
These included internal hardware components something I was already fairly well versed in from buildiing towers as a kid.
We also learned different computing counts which was new to me save for binary which I knew of and had moderate exposure to.
Following these more basic lessons we dug into our collaboration tool GitHub. It was a little tricky at first but I believe that I am getting the hang of it and have now successfully completed several commits, pulls, pushes, etc.
I am excited to start the real coding tomorrow as that is what I am here for. I have so many ideas spinning in my head and can't wait to see them thru to fruition.
Day ones note will be a little shorter as it is obviously a very introductory and surface level overview of what this course will intail. I expect my journals to get more complex as my code grows in complexity.
Here is to a new exiting experience for me, look out day 2 here I come!

Today I learned a ton and feel like I am already grasping at least some base concepts in html and CSS. The morning lecture was a little frusterating and I still didn't accomplish the file replacement task with the .bat file.
It didn't seem like anyone really did though, it was actually a really complicated task.
The afternoon went really well my website looks terrible but I made a ton of changes to it from formating in CSS to adding more pictures and links in html. 
I really need to learn to commit a ton more of the changes I am making so you guys can see my various revisions. For today however I think that is my night, time to go to work!
