TGIF!!

Great week crazy to think that the second one is already complete. I learned a ton this week and I already have a good jump on the weekend assignment.
I finished my NIM game and Happy numbers, my AI is stupid but the functionality is really good for everything else. 
I couldn't figure out how  to do the math to find NIM sums for multiple piles, with the binary conversion and everything else involved it was simply beyond me.
