Reflection 4-5

We got a project today which seems straight forward but actually turned out to be rather tough.
The directions themselves were not to clear and that confused me for alot of the morning.
After having Adam explain however I got a solid start to the project which is essentially just making a bunch of different custom String manipulation classes.
