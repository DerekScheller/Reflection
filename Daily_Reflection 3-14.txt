3-14-16 Reflection

Wholey exam!! It took me roughly 6 hours straight thru to finish. Conceptually it was not that difficult for me.
I had to use some pretty huge workarounds though since we couldn't look online. I couldn't remember the Array equivillant of the list command contains.
So that ended up being a whole thing but in the end I completed each of the three problems and for two of the three I completed all of the Bonus assignments.
I felt it went really well and I await the results, I hope this will move me into the more advanced scrum group.
