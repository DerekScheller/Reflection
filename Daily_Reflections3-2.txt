Reflection Day 3 3-2-16
Today was alright alot of free time I do wish that we saw a slight amount more structure to what we are doing.
I actually made some progress oon my website, it still looks for shit but it definitely am understanding html/css on a much deaper level.
I think that I could make some real strides towards what I would like to do outside of this class with all of the content available online. 
The main problem that I have right now is just that I have my reservations about this course as far as the support to $$ trade off that I am getting.
I really like the idea of it but I am honestly starting to wonder if the structure is properly set up and defined as far as creating software designers go.
I think that it is so early on and I need to give it time but I also want to learn quick and be supported like promissed.
