Reflection 4-4-16

Today we finished up our netflix projects and then got lectures from Ben on both optimization and Data Structures. 
While highly informative, the lectures were also a bit overwhelming without having the information immediately applied.
I think that I will grasp them much better once I am able to apply them to projects this week but until that happens I will just have to stay overwhelmed.
I am excited to start learning from Ben more as we go foreward as I do like his lecture style, his general intellegence, and how much he involves the class.
I'm very excited for this weeks projects as he said that it will be a tough week which in the end is what we are looking for, to be challenged.
