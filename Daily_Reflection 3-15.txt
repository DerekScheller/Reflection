Today was our first day with C# and Visual Studio. 
I spent the morning trying to do an impossible math problem from a website that Mike suggested.
I got pretty close and was at least able to create the intial binary series of Theu values but couldn't quite get the second part.
Only 400 people have ever solved it though so I am not too discouraged seeing as most of the other problems had hundreds of thousands who had solved them.
After that I realized that there was a problem on the board that Andrew put up so I started to work on it in JAVA.
It is a Roman numeral converter that works both ways, while I did not complete it in JAVA, I was able to finish it in C#!!!
Can't wait to learn more about the software tomorrow.
